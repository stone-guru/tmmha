** features
*** DONE store crawled model information to postgresql database as tmmpy
*** DONE hire postgresql-simple package   
*** DONE support user application using there own context and sharing it between parsers and processors
    function curry is enough
*** image format detect
    detect image format from reponsed bytestring instead of url file extension.
*** DONE add nth selector support in Selector module
*** restrict node search range within its parent
    for example, in this statement (at ".level1 .level2" $ textOf "span"), searching of span tag must
be in the branch of .level2. if go out of .level2, search should fail.

 exception from injected function within bracket cause loop stoped.
