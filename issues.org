* Scraha Issues
** application features
*** DONE store crawled model information to postgresql database as tmmpy

*** DONE hire postgresql-simple package   
*** DONE image format detect
    detect image format from reponsed bytestring instead of url file extension.
** selector features
*** DONE add nth selector support in Selector module
*** DONE add reverse order nth selector support in Selector module
*** DONE restrict node search range within its parent
    for example, in this statement (at ".level1 .level2" $ textOf "span"), searching of span tag must
be in the branch of .level2. if go out of .level2, search should fail.
*** DONE provide textAfter function
    textAfter function can get text content after a certain node
** spider framework feature
*** DONE support user application using there own context and sharing it between parsers and processors
    function curry is enough, but more feature is adding continuslly.
*** DONE support cookies to continue Douban books
   Douban have detected it's a spider and bang it
*** DONE parser can retuan any data type instead of only value, and processor can receive it
   Bingo! by Phantom types
*** TODO use different parser types to indicate different data requirement.
   for example, some parser just need parsed tags, and some bioplate codes should be eliminated.
** bugs
*** DONE process function error cause whole loop stoped
 exception from injected function within bracket cause loop stoped.
** Optimazation
*** TODO Use GHC Rules at "map (textTag b2t) $ F.parseTags bytes"
